# if main.py is run with option -r, hyperparameter values are randomly sampled.
# * '50-500' means sampling from uniform distribution over interval
# * '0.001~0.1' means sampling from log distribution over interval
# * 'yes|no', 'dot|cos' etc. means sampling from list of discrete options
# Please respect float = 0.0, int = 0 or it crashes :)
